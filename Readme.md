# SMAC - SlaveMaker Actionscript Core files (adjusted for transpilation)

This project contains a curated set of ActionScript source files derived from the [Source Release of SlaveMaker 3.5](https://slavemaker3.blogspot.com/2019/12/source-release-for-slavemaker.html), and developed in accordance with its terms of use.

It was originally developed as one puzzle piece (among many) in the quest to port SlaveMaker 3.5 to the web platform.
A source-to-source compiler for the game has allowed powerful linting tools for JavaScript and TypeScript to be applied to its ActionScript source files and a range of bugs to be discovered.
