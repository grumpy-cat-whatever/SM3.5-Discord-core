## SlaveMaker 3.5 Terms of Use

Original blog post by cmacleod entitled "Source Release for SlaveMaker", announcing the release (including terms of use):
https://slavemaker3.blogspot.com/2019/12/source-release-for-slavemaker.html

The relevant parts (including context):

>I am not sure if I will continue the game, and given Flash is reaching end of life at the end of next year it would need to rely on 3rd party players or a massive re-write.
>
>I have been requested to release the source code for the game, here it is \[link redacted\],
 approx 20Gb
>
>...
>
>Please do not take this as approval for someone to take over the game as such. I do completely give approval for someone to continue a separate 'fork', so 'SlaveMaker - Bob's Version' or whatever. Do what you like with the source code.
>
>**I DO NOT** give approval for any of this to be used in any way for a commercial reason, and this includes Patreon/SubscribeStar etc. There is far too much in the game that is being used on a fair use basis or just un-credited
